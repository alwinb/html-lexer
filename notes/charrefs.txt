Personal notes on character references
======================================

From reading the specification, I have gathered the following. 
There are three types of character references: decimal, hexadecimal and named. 
In addition, each of those may either be terminated by a ';' or be nonterminated. 

Decimal and Hexadecimal Character references
--------------------------------------------

decimal: 
	/&#[0-9]+;/

nonterminated decimal: 
	/&#[0-9]+/

hexadecimal: 
	/&#[xX][0-9A-Fa-f]+;/

nonterminated hexadecimal: 
	/&#[xX][0-9A-Fa-f]+/

* All nonterminated decimal and hexadecimal references produce a 'nonterminated' parse error. 
* All decimal and hexadecimal references refer to a character, even in the presence of an error. 
* Some (both terminated and nonterminated) produce a 'not in valid range' parse error,
	by #number lookup table. If they do, IIRC they produce the unicode replacement character. 


Named character references
--------------------------

Named references are more complicated. 
The difficulty is illustrated by the following example in the spec. 

>	"I'm &notit; I tell you" is parsed as "I'm ¬it; I tell you" (and this is a parse error). 
>	"I'm &notin; I tell you" is parsed as "I'm ∉ I tell you" (and no parse error).

I prefer to formalise this as follows, which should be equivalent to the spec. 
Consider strings of the following format. 
All the named entities in the (provided) table have one of these two formats. 
Moreover, any nonterminated entry in the table, is also present with a terminating ';'. 

named maybe-reference:
	/&[A-Za-z0-9]+;/

nonterminated named maybe-reference:
	/&[A-Za-z0-9]+/


According to the specification, these strings (call them lexemes) may be interpreted as one of:

1. Data (a string of characters starting with &)
2. A single character reference
3. A character reference followed by data

According to the following rules. 

* Find the longest entry in the table which is a prefix of the lexeme. 
	* If none is found, then the lexeme is parsed as data (1)
		* If the lexeme is terminated then this is a parse error ('not an entity'),
	* If it is exactly the lexeme, then it is parsed as a single reference (2). 
		* If in addition the lexeme is not terminated then this is a parse error ('non terminated entity'). 
	* If it is a prefix of the lexeme (this only happens when the lexeme is not terminated)
		then it is parsed as a reference, a 'non-terminated entity' parse errror, and the remaining characters as data. 


* * * 

So, it's possible to preprocess the table, to extract
1. the nonterminated entities
2. the terminated entities that have one of the nonterminated entities as a prefix.
